REFLECTION

Overall, I think I executed the vision from my proposal fairly well. I included all phases and transitions I intended to, and I drew inspiration from the surrounding environment as well as the shapes in the phases too. I think I successfully produced a soundscape in which the listener was immersed in the world of the frog, or at least the vision I had for the world of the frog. In actually creating the piece, there was a lot of trial and error. I had specific visions of how I wanted each piece to sound, but I had to find a corresponding sound and figure out how to edit it to sound how I wanted it to. That was somewhat of a challenge as I am still fairly inexperienced in the Audacity program and knowing exactly what each of the editing and effects options were. I did stray from my original plan a bit, especially with the transitions. At first, I wanted the project to be fairly realistic and flow together, as if you just sped up the life of a frog and were listening to the important parts. However, when it came to the first transition, I found a cartoon-ish egg cracking sound and I immediately liked the less realistic and exaggerated version. From there, I decided to have the transitions stand alone surrounded by a few seconds of silence so that it was a bit jarring and unexpected. I also decided to have a bit of an intro and closing to help ready the listener at the start and give a sense of closure at the end. There were no real technical issues I encountered where I had to completely rethink the project, just a lot of doing and undoing to figure out what worked the best. The project was fun and allowed me to have hands-on learning on Audacity while creating a cool project that was achievable and gave room for my creativity to flourish.
