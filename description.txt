CDM Soundscape

Title: The Life Cycle of a Frog

About: This soundscape is inspired by the frog lifecycle. It includes 5 phases -- egg, tadpole, froglet, adult, death -- as well as the transitions between each. Each stage is approximately 30 seconds long, then it moves into the transition which is buffered on either side with a few moments of silence to explicitly denote and highlight the change in form. This is a creative and dramatized version of what I imagine the life cycle to be like. I want the listeners to take on a "first-frog" POV and feel like they themselves are going through the life cycle as a frog.
